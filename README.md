# Cake Catalog Website

## What is this?

This website is intended for displaying a catalog that showcases cakes. Visitors can see the list of delicious cakes that are made by someone's Mother and see how to buy the cakes.

## What do we use to build this website?

We use Beego, a MVC web framework that is built for Go (Programming Language). We also use PostgreSQL as the main database.
